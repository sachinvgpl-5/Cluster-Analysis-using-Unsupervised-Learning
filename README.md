# Cluster-Analysis-using-Unsupervised-Learning
This project shows the implementation of cluster analysis on fashion MNIST dataset, using unsupervised machine learning, where we train our model to group unlabeled data into 10 clusters and test the accuracy of our clustering models against the provided labels. We employ three models to do this task and compare accuracy and loss of the clusters generated by each of them.
